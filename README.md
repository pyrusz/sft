# sft
Simple font rendering library for XCB, based on Freetype and Fontconfig.
Sft uses the same dependencies as Xft, but uncertain if this is supposed to be an implementation of that.

This repository was forked from joshuakraemer/sft.

There was an error in one of the includes.

When working on porting it, I was informed that this may be incomplete, at least the Makefile is.

joshuakraemer/sft lacks a README, so, you'll have to understand C and Makefiles to see what so far has been done, and what's needed.

Alternatively, https://github.com/venam/fonts-for-xcb may be the port to use for fonts.
